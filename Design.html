This version of the poster is the one that was sent in promotional posters across the university.

				This was an early project for my typography class from my Sophomore year. We were asked to choose a book and design a brand new cover, thus, I chose One Flew Over the Cuckoo's net as it was my favorite book I read in High School and decided it needed it's flowers.
