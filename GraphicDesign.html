		 <h2>Wage the War on Poverty</h2>
	 <p>This design was a project for my intro to communication design class, we were given a selection of stock images to choose from and the general parameters that the text must be black on white, and have two columns. </p>
	Additionally, we were required to make a cover page and I had to find a way to satisfy both the need for a cover image and legibility of the text.
	<p>When I first began this project I dreaded the task of having to balance content and graphics, but I think this assignment helped me learn the balance between the two.
		<p>
			On a more self-indulgent note, i <u>love</u> the accent font i used for the title and subheadings.

I dropped the "grow ass man" and decided to make him look smaller, but still with the suit. I decided to have his eyes larger than the first sketches. It makes him cuter? Of course, but I think the eyes with that build is better, not only that but it sorta makes him seem like he is starring off into space. Because of that he sorta reminds me of Nekojiru's cats (of course) and Mae from Night in the Woods. My idea is that he is, like, a force of good that helps people in need. Kinda of cheesy idea, but it was what I had. If I use him somewhere, it would probably be in a train or something similar. Seems like the perfect place to a weird cat help people's lives.</p>

I tried my best coming up with what would happen in the drawing, because, frankly, I've forgoten most episodes of Woody Woodpecker that I watched as a kid (and the version Dani was more accustomed with was pretty different from mine), but in the end I made something pretty simple after listening to my mom's suggestions. The picture on the background is from the Get Along Gang, another cartoon that Dani watched as a kid.</p>

They gave me some Homestuck characters to draw, although I remember I also just decided to draw some just because. The characters are June Egbert, Roxy Lalonde, Vriska Serket, Calliope and I also drew Superstitional Realism from Horse Race Tests because they have them as their pfp. I've never actually draw some of these characters that much, so it was pretty fun.

Because of that I thought "hmmm, I should make a Making Fiends fanart 'cause I liked watching the web series". So did just that!! The desings are entirely based on already existing desings made by other artists (which I don't remember the name, but I'm sure you've seen them before).

Her birthday is on the 12th of April, but I ended up being late and only finished it on the 21th. Tori also didn't minded to wait, but I'm a little ashamed it took that long. She had told me her birthday while I was making Zoru's I belive, then I decided to make her a gift as well. Due to personal reasons, I never manage to give her a gift, so I was determined to make this one. She started liking Sonic a lot a few months ago and she really likes Shadamy (Shadow x Amy), so I drew them together (it was the very first idea I had when she told me her birthday LoL). Even though I've been a Sonic fan since I was a kid, I don't think I've drew Shadow nor Amy (or at least not as much as Sonic and maybe Tails), so I had a little hard time while making the sketches. After a while I ended up deciding they should be on the Chao garden taking care of, well, Chao. I mean, the Chao Garden is sorta like a virtual pet, so it could be interpreted as the child they're taking care of. It also took me sometime to figure out how the lightning should work on this scenario, but I think I've made something that makes at least some sense (the light is supposed to come from the right btw). Tori really liked it! Hours passed and she still was thinking about it. Again, I'm not the best with compliments, but I felt really happy! I hope I was able to show my gratitude (;;-`_´-) not only to her, but to everyone, really!</p>

Her birthday was on the 9th of April, but due to my therapist's drawing I ended up finishing it some days later, that's why the date on the drawing and the one I'm using doesn't match. Zoru understood the situation and she didn't really minded I was late. I always wanted to draw one of her OCs, but I never felt I was something good, so I decided to give another shot this time, considering I have my own drawing tablet and I felt I was doing digital art way better than before. Oh and made her OC do the Josuke pose because she likes JoJo's and I feel that pose in particular is pretty iconic. She was really happy when I gave it to her and I felt really flattered! I consider all of my friends to be really amazing artists, so getting compliments from them makes me unsure on how to respond, but I am truly grateful that I've met them. I promise I'll always do my best!</p>

I was going to make a Gachiakuta one, because he really likes the manga, but I wasn't satisfied on the way I drew the Protag, so I decided to circle back to Fullmetal since it's a work that we both like and I felt I would've been able to draw Ed and Al no problem. The drawing is based of the first ending of Brotherhood. I haven't seen the anime (No reason in particular, I'm just accustomed reading the manga first if possible), but I'm familiar with the outro because of Kenshirou Morii, it's animator. I'm a big fan of his works on Siinamota's Strobe Light and Year 3 Class C-14 so I ended up finding <a href="https://youtu.be/-XlSNDOhuI0?si=g_85i-NGPbp4kED6">this one</a> eventually. Geovane really liked his gift and he said he enjoyed my works in general! I honestly didn't really knew how to reply, but I'm really glad he liked it!!</p>

It depicts some turtle guards and an antagonist for the story. The turtles are part of the kingdom as well, but they appear more as guards, from what I understood. I'm gonna be honest: I think we still need to iron them out, because I dunno if they serve much pourpose for the story. The bunny guy is, as I said before, an antagonist. He is supposed to be a threath to the protagonist, because he knows there is a "spy" among them, but he doesn't know who. I also had the idea that he would genually think of the protag as a friend, because I think this could make things harder later on. In personality I thought of making him some sort of entertaining piece of shit.</p>

According to our "lore master", white bunnies with upward ears are an exception to the common people and are take by the royalty to serve as an "attraction" of sorts. Because of that, I figured the main character souldn't be a white rabbit and I tried to make different fur patterns that could make that obvious, since everyone wants the comic to be black and white. There still is some "white" (is it still white if I'm just making sketches and I don't have much to color?) versions, but with a few differences, like one ear being cut-off or him having red eyes</p>

It's about bunnies living in a monarchy and the ones with their ears down are royalty, while the ones with ears up are just the common people that are opressed. This is just some sketches to get the hang of things of how they should look.</p>

    <p>[04/02/2025] A friend of mine is getting on Sonic and she was making some Sonic gijinkas. I always saw gijinkas and thought "that's pretty cool!" so I decided to do one as well. I think the shirt is kinda lame, but the rest is looking nice. She also asked me to make a Shadow gijinka and I'm still working on it, so wait for that one, alright?</p>

<p>[07/01/2025] While I was messing around with my friends on the course, I remember my teacher suggested us to go to one of the rooms because he was giving a talk about concept art, I think, and we could draw there. So we went there and heard him. Everyone else that were there was drawing the Mjolnir, Thor's hammer, but they're supposed to give their own desing. I, however, decided to sketch some things, and I came up with this sheriff guy! I can't explain the idea that well, but I thought him up while thinking about "cute horror stuff" (I don't mean mascot horror, I mean, like, cute stuff being creppy). He is just a sweet guy that is an stiched up dog (or something, I didn't thought about it too hard) that doesn't like conflict that much</p>

<p style="position: relative; bottom: 60px;">[??/01/2025] This is a nameless deer character. I didn't thought of making them a deer, but I felt giving them some cut-off antlers would work. I didn't thought much about the desing and such, but I feel it's kinda similar to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@mammalfriend">mammalfriend</a>'s style, which wasn't my intention. Also they're holding a donut on one of the doodles because I wasn't really sure what put there, so I ended up just going with something simple. </p>

<p style="position: relative; bottom: 40px;">[??/01/2025] Random doodles I made since I wasn't really sure what to draw. The text "present day, present time" is from Lain and I remember I saw it on youtube on the same day and I thought it was kinda funny. Also the "bunny" character sometimes doesn't look that much like a bunny, it reminds of Deerling from Pokémon (probably because the face and ears are kinda similar)</p>
